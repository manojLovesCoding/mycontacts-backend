# üöÄ Excited to Share My Latest Project: Contact Manager Backend! üöÄ

I'm thrilled to present my **Contact Manager Backend Application** built using **MongoDB**, **Express**, and **Node.js**! This project helped me deepen my understanding of backend development while implementing essential features like **user authentication** and **secure data access**. 

---

## **Project Overview:**

The Contact Manager is a simple API that allows users to manage their contacts securely. The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their contacts, with the added security of user authentication. Only authenticated users can interact with their own data.

---

## **Key Features:**

### üîê **User Registration & Login:**
- Users are required to register and login before they can perform any actions on their contacts.

### üîë **Access Tokens:**
- Upon login, users receive a JSON Web Token (**JWT**) that is required for authentication when performing CRUD operations.

### üîí **Secure Data Access:**
- Users can only modify or delete their own contacts. One user cannot access or modify another user's contacts, ensuring privacy and security.

### üîß **API Testing with Thunder-Client:**
- I used **Thunder-Client** to test all the API endpoints and ensure they work as expected, providing a smooth and efficient user experience.

## **Technologies Used:**

- **Backend:**
  - **Node.js** (Runtime Environment)
  - **Express.js** (API Framework)
  - **MongoDB** & **Mongoose** (Database Management)
  - **bcrypt** (Password Hashing)
  - **jsonwebtoken (JWT)** (User Authentication)
  - **express-async-handler** (Error Handling)
  - **dotenv** (Environment Variables)
  - **nodemon** (Automatic Server Restart During Development)

## **Learning Experience:**

This project was an incredibly valuable learning experience. It allowed me to apply the backend concepts I‚Äôve learned in a real-world scenario, focusing on user authentication, security, and building a secure API. 

I'm proud of the result, and I feel confident that this project has improved my skills in backend development.
